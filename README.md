# Spice circuit simulator

Spice 🌶️ is a native macOS electronic circuit simulator that rivals LTSpice and other legacy software 🤮. It has a new, modern interface ⭐️ with easy-to-use features and smooth performance. Totally free and open source.

## Getting started

You can download the [latest version](https://github.com/l0uisgrange/spice/releases/latest) and run it directly.

#### Requirements
Spice only runs on **macOS Sonoma** 14.0+ and currently supports the following languages:
- 🇩🇰 Danish
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇮🇹 Italian

As I am just a human being like you, I would really appreciate your help in correcting translations into your language. Please open an issue to start.

## File format

Spice supports the original SPICE netlists (files), developed in 1975 and widely used for circuit simulation. However, it mainly uses it's own `.spice` format, which looks like this:

```text
* Data statements
R1 0 10 T 100
V1 0 10 B DC 150
```

For more information on how this works, see the documentation [Wiki](https://github.com/l0uisgrange/spice/wiki).

## Suggestions

Check out my roadmap to see what I'm working on. You can also suggest new features, bug fixes or improvements to existing features by creating a new issue!

## About me 👀

I'm a Swiss 🇨🇭 developer who is tired of seeing bad UX/UI in macOS apps in the engineering world. That's why I create beautiful, user-friendly apps that follow Apple's design guidelines.
